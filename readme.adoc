== eslint notes

After some testing, I figured an eslint quirk (more specifically of "eslint-plugin-react-refresh") that the constants need to have at least *two words* joined together with an underscore, otherwise the plugin will complain like:

> Fast refresh only works when a file only export components. Use a new file to share constant or functions between components

[source,javascript]

// this fails linting
export const STYLES = {...}

// this is ok with linting, notice two words joined together
